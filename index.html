              Allow me to introduce myself as Aryan Faghirollahi, a passionate
              and dedicated individual, committed to academic excellence and
              entrepreneurial endeavors. Presently, I am pursuing dual degrees
              in telecommunication engineering and computer engineering at the
              prestigious University of Kurdistan, aiming to specialize in the
              field of cybersecurity. In 2023, I took a bold step and
              established my own startup, VGOSTAR, where we focus on the
              implementation of cutting-edge Augmented Reality (AR) technology
              for both industrial and advertising applications. Our primary
              mission is to actively contribute to the ongoing global transition
              to web3, embracing the limitless potential of the digital realm.
              In addition to my entrepreneurial pursuits, I also actively engage
              as a back-end developer, further honing my technical skills and
              contributing to various software development projects. Beyond my
              professional pursuits, I find joy in embracing adventures with my
              beloved car, Lucy, and capturing life's precious moments through
              the lens of my trusted companion, the Nikon D5300 camera.
              Embracing a sense of wonder and creativity in all aspects of my
              life, I constantly seek new challenges and opportunities for
              personal and professional growth.

                  AR is used, what AR can do today—and in the future—and the
                  various technologies used for building such experiences. You
                  will also learn about computer vision in AR, the software
                  development lifecycle, and careers in AR development. To be
                  successful in this course, experience with object oriented

                  During my first management experience, I served as the Chief
                  of the UOK Photoclub. This club was established as a platform
                  for students who were either photographers or simply
                  interested in the field of photography. I took on the
                  responsibility of leading the club for a period of 9 months,
                  during which we encountered and successfully addressed three
                  significant challenges. Throughout my tenure, we organized and
                  conducted two mobile photography classes and three workshops,
                  which covered diverse aspects of photography, including travel
                  photography, industrial photography, and advertising
                  photography. These events were well-received and helped
                  enhance the skills and knowledge of the club members. However,
                  after the 9-month period, I had to make a difficult decision
                  due to UOK rules that prevented me from simultaneously being a
                  member of both IEEE and the Photoclub. Regrettably, I had to
                  step down from my position in the Photoclub to continue my
                  affiliation with IEEE. Despite my departure, I am proud of the
                  progress we made and the impact we had on the members during
                  my time as the Chief of the UOK Photoclub. I am grateful for
                  the experience and the opportunity to contribute to the growth
                  of the club and its members.

                  During my tenure at Vgostar, I led an innovative and dynamic
                  team committed to continuous improvement. Vgostar, a
                  pioneering company, was dedicated to achieving excellence,
                  which resulted in us receiving the first-place Idea Prize from
                  the University of Kurdistan. This recognition not only
                  validated our vision but also acknowledged our team's
                  dedication and effort, solidifying our position in the market.
                  I also supervised the successful internship program at
                  Vgostar, where we provided invaluable hands-on experience to
                  30 interns. As a CEO, I fostered a positive work environment,
                  promoting creativity and innovation within the team. We
                  successfully developed and launched our first prototype,
                  marking a significant milestone in Vgostar's journey. In my
                  role as CEO, I focused on anticipating industry trends and
                  positioning Vgostar as a major player in the technology
                  sector. This chapter of my career was transformative,
                  enhancing my leadership skills, strategic thinking, and
                  passion for driving technological progress. I am proud of our
                  team's achievements and the positive impact we made on the
                  industry. This experience has enriched me both professionally
                  and personally, and I look forward to applying the lessons
                  learned to future challenges and opportunities.

                  A photography club or photography association is a community
                  of individuals interested in photography, with members having
                  varying levels of photography experience. In a photography
                  club, individuals can share their knowledge and experiences in
                  the field of photography and learn from each other. The
                  activities of a photography club typically include organizing
                  classes, workshops, exhibitions, photography tours, and
                  sometimes even photography competitions. These venues provide
                  an excellent opportunity for social interaction with people
                  who share an interest in photography and enhance their
                  photography skills. In a photography club, photographers can
                  experience a wide range of subjects, from capturing natural
                  landscapes to portrait photography, and discover new ideas for
                  their projects. These gatherings not only contribute to the
                  development of photography skills but also create valuable
                  social connections and facilitate the exchange of experiences
